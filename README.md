### What is the repository all About ? 
I created this repo to document my learning journey and some of my experiments with Python as a Newbie. I will play around with some Frameworks, Libraries, and interesting concepts and make them well-structured for other Newbies learning.

### Some stuff I hope Experiment 
- Building better Microservices and APIs
- Machine learning and Deep learning
- DevOps concepts 
- Algorithms and Data structures 
- General Programming best practices 

### Contributing guide 
- Coming soon (Probably)
